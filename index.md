## About Me

I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate (PDRA) at the [School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/). I obtained a PhD degree at the same university under the supervision of [Heng Guo](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hguo/). Prior to that, I got a Bachelor of Science *(summa cum laude)* at [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/) and was a member of PKU's Turing Class. Previous experience could be found in the CV provided above. 

#### Misc

* My [Erdős-Bacon-Sabbath number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Bacon_number) is **infinity** - I am not revealing the Erdős number here (but it is 3). One of my life goals is to bound this number by a constant. 
* If you add "misc" after the slash of this page's URL then you could find some personal stuff like hobbies.

## Research

My research interest lies in several topics in theoretical computer science. To be more precise, I enjoy problems with inspiring combinatorial structures and/or surprising computational hardness. That includes (randomised) algorithms and complexity of approximate counting, and extremal/probabilistic combinatorics. 

The focus of my recent research is different aspects of approximate counting problems beyond (in)tractability, such as random structures, derandomisation, fine-grained perspective, parameterised counting, applications to other fields, and so on. 

For a full list of research articles, please view [this page](/research).

<p style="font-size:13pt; font-weight:bold"> Two selected papers: </p>

**Inapproximability of counting hypergraph colourings**  
*with* [Andreas Galanis](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/andreas.galanis/myindex.html) and [Heng Guo](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hguo/)  
**ACM Trans. Comput. Theory**, 14(3-4):10, pp. 1-33, 2022  
* This is my debut paper in the study of approximate algorithms, and a showcase of my mathematical analysis skills.  
* We show that approximately counting hypergraph colourings remains hard even within the Lovász local lemma (LLL) regime, under which the searching problem is tractable due to Moser-Tardos Algorithm. The hardness bound we obtain is square-root of that for the searching problem. Therefore, we confirm the "sampling-is-computationally-harder" phenomenon for this prototypical problem where LLL was originally developed. 

**A simple polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the total variation distance between two product distributions**  
*with* [Weiming Feng](https://fwm94.github.io/), [Heng Guo](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hguo/) and [Mark Jerrum](https://webspace.maths.qmul.ac.uk/m.jerrum/)  
**TheoretiCS**, Volume 2 (2023), Article 8, 1-7 (preliminary version in **SOSA 2023**)  
* This is a showcase of simplicity that, albeit within 5 pages, exploits and manipulates the fundamental aspect of coupling, a tool that is used frequently in probability theory.  
* We give {Insert title here}, despite the exact computation is known to be #P-hard and does not admit any polynomial-time algorithm unless FP=#P.
