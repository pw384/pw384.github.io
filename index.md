## About Me

I am a third-year PhD student at the [School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/). It is an honour for me to be supervised by [Heng Guo](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hguo/). Prior to that, I obtained Bachelor of Science *(summa cum laude)* at [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/), majoring in computer science, and was a member of PKU's Turing Class. 

My undergraduate research advisor is [Xiaoming Sun](http://theory.ict.ac.cn/en/) from Institute of Computing Technology, CAS. I also worked with [Pinyan Lu](http://itcs.shufe.edu.cn/pinyan) and [Chihao Zhang](http://chihaozhang.com/) for my last few months of my undergraduate study. 

My research interest lies in several topics in theoretical computer science. To be more precise, I enjoy problems with inspiring combinatorial structures. That includes extremal graph theory, (randomised) algorithms and complexity of approximate counting. 

Aside from academic topics, I am also fond of abundant recreations, from playing bass guitar to video games. Unfortunately, my busy days force me to put those hobbies aside, as I can no longer devote any much towards competitive gaming.
