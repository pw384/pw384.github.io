## About Me

I am a (former) student at Peking University, majoring in computer science. I was doing research under the supervision of [Xiaoming Sun](http://theory.ict.ac.cn/en/) at Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, for my third and fourth year during undergraduate study. I spent an unforgettable summer at University of Edinburgh under supervision of [Heng Guo](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hguo/), and I am inspired by him a lot. Currently, I am working with [Pinyan Lu](http://itcs.shufe.edu.cn/pinyan), [Chihao Zhang](http://chihaozhang.com/), etc., studying about approximate counting. 

My research interest lies in several topics in theoretical computer science. To be more precise, I enjoy problems with inspiring combinatorial structures. That includes, randomness in computation, sampling and counting, Boolean functions, and graph theory. 

Aside from academic topics, I am also fond of abundant recreations, from playing bass guitar to video games. Unfortunately, my busy days force me to put those hobbies aside.

I will join the University of Edinburgh for a PhD soon.
