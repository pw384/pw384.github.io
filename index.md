## About Me

I am a grade-4 undergraduate student at Peking University, majoring in computer science. Currently I am doing research under the supervision of [Xiaoming Sun](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/s/Sun:Xiaoming) at Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I spent an unforgettable summer at University of Edinburgh under supervision of [Heng Guo](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hguo/), and I am inspired by him a lot. 

My research interest lies in several topics in theoretical computer science. To be more precise, I enjoy problems with inspiring combinatorial structures. That includes, randomness in computation, sampling and counting, Boolean functions, and graph theory. 

Aside from academic topics, I am also fond of abundant recreations, from playing bass guitar to video games. Unfortunately, my busy days force me to put those hobbies aside. 

## Research

On the Degree of Boolean Functions as Polynomials over $\mathbb{Z}_m$  
*Joint work with Xiaoming Sun, Yuan Sun, Kewen Wu, Zhiyu Xia, and Yufan Zheng*  
arXiv: [1910.12458](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12458).
