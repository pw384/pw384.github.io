## About Me

I am a grade 4 undergraduate student at Peking University, majoring in computer science. 

My research interest lies in several topics in theoretical computer science. To be more precise, I enjoy problems with inspiring combinatorial structures. That includes, randomness in computation, sampling and counting, Boolean functions, and graph theory. 

Aside from academic topics, I am also fond of abundant recreations, from playing bass guitar to video games. Unfortunately, my busy days force me to put those hobbies aside. 

## Research

On the Degree of Boolean Functions as Polynomials over $\mathbb{Z}_m$

*Joint work with Xiaoming Sun, Yuan Sun, Kewen Wu, Zhiyu Xia, and Yufan Zheng*
