## About Me

I am a third-year PhD student at the [School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/). It is an honour for me to be supervised by [Heng Guo](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hguo/). Prior to that, I obtained Bachelor of Science *(summa cum laude)* at [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/), majoring in computer science, and was a member of PKU's Turing Class. My undergraduate research advisor is [Xiaoming Sun](http://theory.ict.ac.cn/en/) from Institute of Computing Technology, CAS. I also worked with [Pinyan Lu](http://itcs.shufe.edu.cn/pinyan) and [Chihao Zhang](http://chihaozhang.com/) for my last few months of my undergraduate study. 

My research interest lies in several topics in theoretical computer science. To be more precise, I enjoy problems with inspiring combinatorial structures. That includes (randomised) algorithms and complexity of approximate counting, and extremal graph theory. 

#### Misc

* Aside from academic topics, I am also fond of abundant recreations, from playing bass guitar to video games. Unfortunately, my busy days force me to put those hobbies aside, as I can no longer devote any much towards competitive gaming.
* My [Erdős-Bacon-Sabbath number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Bacon_number) is **infinity** - I am not revealing the Erdős number here ;)

## Research

<p style="font-size:14pt; font-weight:bold"> I take pride in the following selected papers: </p>

**Inapproximability of counting hypergraph colourings**  
*with* [Andreas Galanis](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/andreas.galanis/myindex.html) and [Heng Guo](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hguo/)  
**ACM Trans. Comput. Theory**, 14(3-4):10, pp. 1-33, 2022  
* This is my debut paper in the study of approximate algorithms, and a showcase of my mathematical analysis skills.  
* We show that approximately counting hypergraph colourings remains hard even within the Lovász local lemma (LLL) regime, under which the searching problem is tractable due to Moser-Tardos Algorithm. The hardness bound we obtain is square-root of that for the searching problem. Therefore, we confirm the "sampling-is-computationally-harder" phenomenon for this prototypical problem where LLL was originally developed. 

**A simple polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the total variation distance between two product distributions**  
*with* [Weiming Feng](https://fwm94.github.io/), [Heng Guo](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hguo/) and [Mark Jerrum](https://webspace.maths.qmul.ac.uk/m.jerrum/)  
**TheoretiCS**, *to appear* (preliminary version in **SOSA 2023**)  
* This is a showcase of simplicity that, albeit within 5 pages, exploits and manipulates the fundamental aspect of coupling, a tool that is used frequently in probability theory.  
* We give {Insert title here}, despite the exact computation is known to be #P-hard and does not admit any polynomial-time algorithm unless FP=#P.
