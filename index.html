<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>I am a grade-4 undergraduate student at Peking University, majoring in computer science. Currently I am doing research under the supervision of <a href="https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/s/Sun:Xiaoming">Xiaoming Sun</a> at Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I spent an unforgettable summer at University of Edinburgh under supervision of <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hguo/">Heng Guo</a>, and I am inspired by him a lot.</p>

<p>My research interest lies in several topics in theoretical computer science. To be more precise, I enjoy problems with inspiring combinatorial structures. That includes, randomness in computation, sampling and counting, Boolean functions, and graph theory.</p>

<p>Aside from academic topics, I am also fond of abundant recreations, from playing bass guitar to video games. Unfortunately, my busy days force me to put those hobbies aside.</p>
