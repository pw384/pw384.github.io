## Good metal albums

Here's a list of metal *albums* that I find euphorically enjoyable ðŸ˜‹! Warning: I'm not a metalhead so do not expect super brutal stuff from me.  
Linkin Park or System of a Down or whatever is somehow more on the rock side, so it's not in the list. (I am applying the criteria of Encyclopaedia Metallum, sorry!)  
Sorted in alphabetical order. Also I'm trying to include only one album per capita.

* Amon Amarth - Twilight of the Thunder God (2008)  
* Ensiferum - Ensiferum (2001)  
* Finntroll - NattfÃ¶dd (2004)
* Insomnium - Heart like a Grave (2019)  
* Nightwish - Imaginarerum (2011)  
* Shylmagoghnar - Emergence (2014)  
* Wintersun - Wintersun (2004)  
* Within Temptation - The Unforgiving (2011)  

May update constantly to recollect stuff that slips off my head right now.
